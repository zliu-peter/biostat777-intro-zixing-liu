    "text": "I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Science in Molecular & Cellular Biology and a minor in Applied Math and Statistics. My previous research has been on therapeutic compound discovery leveraging M13 phage display and next-generation sequencing. Broadly speaking, I am passionate about multi-omics and/or precision medicine approaches to tackle chronic and complex illnesses, such as identifying biomarkers or characterizing individual variability to better prevent, diagnose, and manage chronic diseases. At JHSPH, I hope to gain more experience in clinical trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | Sc.M. in Biostatistics | Current\nJohns Hopkins University | B.S. in Molecular & Cellular Biology | May 2023\n\n\n\nExperience\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine | Research Assistant | The Larman Lab | Feb 2020 - Aug 2023\n\n\n\nInterests and Hobbies\nBlack & white photography, movies/documentaries, watercolor, badminton, traveling, running, chess\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMD, USA.
