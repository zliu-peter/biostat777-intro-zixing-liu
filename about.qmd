I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Science in Molecular & Cellular Biology and a minor in Applied Math and Statistics. My previous research has been on therapeutic compound discovery leveraging M13 phage display and next-generation sequencing. Broadly speaking, I am passionate about multi-omics and/or precision medicine approaches to tackle chronic and complex illnesses, such as identifying biomarkers or characterizing individual variability to better prevent, diagnose, and manage chronic diseases. At JHSPH, I hope to gain more experience in clinical trial.
